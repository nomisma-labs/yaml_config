# How to add code

Recipes for the usual changes. A new repo starts empty and grows through them; cmake_template's
example code (`src/example/`, `apps/hello/`, `tests/`) is the worked reference for each one.
`<repo>` stands for the repo's name, the one in `project()`. Library sources go in `src/`
in every repository. Docs remain in `docs/<repo>/` and tools in `tools/<repo>/`. Names follow
[conventions.md](conventions.md), every new file starts with the SPDX header
([conventions.md](conventions.md#enforcement)), and build commands are in [build.md](build.md).

## A library

The CMake project names the whole repo; library targets have their own names. A repo's main
library normally uses the repo name: target `<repo>`, alias `nom::<repo>`, module `nom.<repo>`.
Module names and CMake aliases do not impose a C++ namespace hierarchy; exported names can
live directly in `nom`.
In `cmake_template`, the illustrative library is instead named `example`: the integration test
uses `find_package(cmake_template)` and links `nom::example`.

1. Put the primary module interface in `src/<repo>/<repo>.cppm`. Define the public API there
   or in interface partitions (`<part>.cppm`); put compiled definitions in implementation units
   (`<file>.cpp`). The [module recipe](#a-module) shows the source layout.
2. Add `src/<repo>/CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   nom_lib(<repo> IMPORT_STD
       MODULES <repo>.cppm thing.cppm
       SOURCES thing.cpp
       HEADERS macros.h         # only when the library needs public macros
       PUBLIC_DEPS <targets>    # dependencies needed by the public interface, if any
       PRIVATE_DEPS <targets>)  # dependencies used only by the implementation, if any
   nom_install_package(TARGETS <repo> DEPENDENCIES <packages>)
   ```

   `DEPENDENCIES` lists the packages needed by exported CMake targets, including private
   dependencies that a static library carries into its link interface. The helper skips
   installation rules when `nom_install` is OFF.
3. Add `add_subdirectory(<repo>)` to `src/CMakeLists.txt`. The initialized scaffold
   already registers `src/` in the root `CMakeLists.txt`.
4. Add its unit tests and library usage integration tests (below).

`nom_lib()` defaults the file-set base to `${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src`. Pass `BASE_DIR`
explicitly for another layout. Installed headers and module sources keep their paths
relative to that base, such as `<repo>/macros.h`, without a `src/` prefix.

Use `STATIC` or `SHARED` in `nom_lib` to select compiled-library linkage explicitly.
They are mutually exclusive and require sources or modules. Omitting both preserves
the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` default. A template-only API still has module sources and is a compiled
module target. An interface target without `SOURCES` or `MODULES` is for macro headers or
third-party dependency adapters.

A second library is named `<repo>_<name>`; list it in the same `nom_install_package()` call, which
a repo makes once.

## A module

Nomisma libraries expose their APIs through native named modules. Their declarations follow the
module declaration; apps and tests consume them with `import nom.<repo>;`.

1. Add `src/<repo>/<repo>.cppm`:
   ```cpp
   export module nom.<repo>;

   export import :thing;
   ```
2. Add the interface partition `src/<repo>/thing.cppm`:
   ```cpp
   export module nom.<repo>:thing;

   export namespace nom
   {
       class thing
       {
       public:
           int value() const;
       };
   } // namespace nom
   ```
   Template definitions belong in the interface or partition too, so importers can instantiate
   them. A small library can define its API directly in the primary interface without partitions.
3. Put compiled definitions in `src/<repo>/thing.cpp`:
   ```cpp
   module nom.<repo>;

   namespace nom
   {
       int thing::value() const
       {
           return 42;
       }
   } // namespace nom
   ```
4. Register the interfaces and partitions unconditionally in `MODULES`, and implementation
   units in `SOURCES`:
   ```cmake
   nom_lib(<repo> IMPORT_STD MODULES <repo>.cppm thing.cppm SOURCES thing.cpp)
   ```
5. Put `import std;` after the named module declaration when using standard-library facilities,
   and pass `IMPORT_STD` to the target helper. Enable the pre-project
   setup described in [build.md](build.md#modules). For macro-bearing or third-party includes,
   start with a global module fragment (`module;`, then the includes). Keep dependencies
   private when the API does not need their types: `src/example/settings.cpp` includes nlohmann
   privately and exports ordinary settings, parsing and serialization services through its
   interface partition. Macros remain in headers; include those before imports in consumers.

More rules and dependency boundaries: [build.md](build.md#modules).

## An app

1. Put `main.cpp` in `apps/<app>/`; import the Nomisma libraries it uses.
2. Add `apps/<app>/CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   nom_app(<app> IMPORT_STD SOURCES main.cpp DEPS nom::<repo>)
   ```
   When `nom_build_apps` is OFF, the helper creates no target or config collection rules.
   The target is `<app>`; the binary is `build/<preset>/bin/<app>`. Choose a target name unique
   across the whole build, including enabled dependency apps. By default it joins
   every preset (`BUILD_FOR any`). Restrict its normal build and installation with:
   ```cmake
   nom_app(<app> IMPORT_STD SOURCES main.cpp DEPS nom::<repo> BUILD_FOR dev ci)
   ```
   Other presets can still build it explicitly by target name. The `complete` preset includes every
   app regardless of this list. Use `BUILD_FOR complete` for prototypes. Apply further target
   settings using the same name, guarded because apps can be disabled:
   ```cmake
   if(TARGET <app>)
       target_compile_definitions(<app> PRIVATE NOM_APP_VERBOSE=1)
       set_target_properties(<app> PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME <binary_name>)
   endif()
   ```
3. Add `add_subdirectory(<app>)` to `apps/CMakeLists.txt`.
4. Put application configuration files in `apps/<app>/config/` when needed. Building any app
   declared in that directory collects the whole folder into `build/<preset>/config/<app>/`.
   The copy runs on each build and removes stale files from the staged folder. Multiple
   executables in the same app directory share one collection target. With `nom_install` enabled and the app selected by the preset,
   `cmake --install` puts the executable in `<prefix>/bin/` and the collected files in
   `<prefix>/config/<app>/`. Build before installing; config generation will be added later.

## A unit test suite

1. Put Catch2 tests under `tests/unit/<suite>/` or inline beside the code in
   `<code dir>/tests/<suite>/`, as `<file>_test.cxx`. Test-only headers are `<name>_test.h`.
   Include Catch2's macro header, then import the library under test:
   ```cpp
   #include <catch2/catch_test_macros.hpp>

   import nom.<repo>;

   TEST_CASE("a thing has a value")
   {
       REQUIRE(nom::thing{}.value() == 42);
   }
   ```
2. Give the folder a `CMakeLists.txt` with one executable:
   ```cmake
   nom_c2test(tests IMPORT_STD SOURCES file_test.cxx DEPS nom::<repo>)
   ```
   `nom_c2test(<suite> …)` builds `<repo>_<suite>`, registers it with CTest and labels it `unit`;
   each folder needs its own suite name (`tests`, `relay_tests`, …). `LABELS` replaces the label,
   such as `LABELS integration` for a slow suite that `dev` builds leave out, and `PROPERTIES`
   sets other test properties, such as `PROPERTIES TIMEOUT 60 RESOURCE_LOCK database`. With
   `nom_build_tests` OFF, it creates neither the executable nor the test.
3. For a top-level suite, add `add_subdirectory(<suite>)` to `tests/unit/CMakeLists.txt`. For an
   inline suite, add this to the code directory's `CMakeLists.txt`, after defining the library:
   ```cmake
   if(nom_build_tests)
       add_subdirectory(tests/<suite>)
   endif()
   ```
   Use unique suite names across both layouts. The root `CMakeLists.txt` enables testing and
   finds Catch2 when tests are enabled before processing code directories, so both layouts can
   call `nom_c2test()`. Keep guards around that dependency discovery and direct `add_test()` calls.

## Library usage integration tests

These verify that a separate project can find, compile against, link and use the library. They
build and run a small program twice: against the installed package through `find_package`, and
against the source tree through `FetchContent`. This checks the public API and CMake integration
that other repos rely on. `nom_library_usage_tests()` registers no tests when `nom_build_tests`
is OFF. With `nom_install` OFF it keeps the source-consumption test and omits the installation
fixture and installed-package test.

1. Add `tests/integration/library_usage/CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 4.4)
   include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../../cmake/kit/std_modules.cmake)
   project(<repo>_library_usage LANGUAGES CXX)

   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 23)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

   if(LIBRARY_USAGE_MODE STREQUAL "package")
       find_package(<repo> CONFIG REQUIRED)
   else()
       include(FetchContent)
       FetchContent_Declare(<repo> SOURCE_DIR ${LIBRARY_USAGE_SOURCE_DIR})
       FetchContent_MakeAvailable(<repo>)
   endif()

   enable_testing()
   add_executable(use_library use_library_test.cxx)
   target_link_libraries(use_library PRIVATE nom::<repo>)
   nom_enable_std_modules(use_library)
   add_test(NAME use_library COMMAND use_library)
   ```
2. Add `tests/integration/library_usage/use_library_test.cxx`: a `main()` that imports the
   library's primary module, uses its API and returns 0 when it works. Use that same source in
   both consumption modes; package consumers rebuild module interfaces for their own compiler.
3. Add `nom_library_usage_tests(library_usage)` to `tests/integration/CMakeLists.txt`. The
   helper labels its tests `integration`. Keep other integration checks here too, with the same
   label. `ctest --preset dev` runs the unit tests without them; `ctest --preset complete` runs
   both, and `ctest --preset complete -L integration` runs these alone.

## A Python package

The shared kit supports optional native Linux wheels. The template's `python/` and
`pyproject.toml` are the worked example; initialization removes them while retaining the kit
and packaging tools. Packaging does not choose or generate the Python API.

1. Put binding sources in `python/` and Python files in `python/<package>/`. The binding must
   export the extension name selected below (`_native`); `__init__.py` can expose its public API.
2. After the root's `add_subdirectory(src)`, enable that directory only on request:
   ```cmake
   if(nom_build_python)
       add_subdirectory(python)
   endif()
   ```
3. Add `python/CMakeLists.txt`, using a shared library target in this example:
   ```cmake
   nom_python_module(<repo>_python IMPORT_STD
       MODULE_NAME _native
       PACKAGE <package>
       SOURCES native.cpp
       DEPS nom::<repo>
       RUNTIME_LIBRARIES nom::<repo>)
   ```
   The helper skips target creation when `nom_build_python` is OFF. Its `nom_python`
   installation rules remain available with `nom_install` OFF, as wheel builds require.
   `DEPS` uses existing source-built or imported CMake targets. List all required shared targets
   in `RUNTIME_LIBRARIES`, including transitive dependencies; the helper installs them beside
   the extension with package-relative loading paths. Omit that argument for dependencies that
   are all static. Source-built static/object targets become position-independent; imported
   static libraries must already contain PIC objects and declare
   `INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON`.

   Imported shared libraries must have a filename-only ELF SONAME and no runtime path or a
   runtime path of exactly `$ORIGIN`; the helper checks them with `readelf`. It copies these
   binaries without repairing them. Declare the complete target dependency graph; conditional
   link expressions other than the supported `LINK_ONLY`/`BUILD_INTERFACE` wrappers are rejected.
   System-library and portable-wheel repair policies are outside this initial helper.
4. Add `pyproject.toml`. Replace `<repo>`, its upper-case `<PROJECT>`, `<distribution>` and
   `<package>`; keep the backend pin aligned with `tools/kit/python_package_requirements.txt`:
   ```toml
   [build-system]
   requires = ["scikit-build-core==0.11.6"]
   build-backend = "scikit_build_core.build"

   [project]
   name = "<distribution>"
   dynamic = ["version"]
   requires-python = ">=3.10"
   license = "MIT"
   license-files = ["LICENSE", "cmake/kit/LICENSE"]

   [tool.scikit-build]
   minimum-version = "build-system.requires"
   cmake.version = ">=4.4,<4.5"
   ninja.version = ">=1.11"
   cmake.build-type = "Release"
   wheel.packages = ["python/<package>"]
   install.components = ["nom_python"]

   [tool.scikit-build.cmake.define]
   <PROJECT>_BUILD_PYTHON = "ON"
   <PROJECT>_BUILD_APPS = "OFF"
   <PROJECT>_BUILD_TESTS = "OFF"
   <PROJECT>_INSTALL = "OFF"

   [tool.scikit-build.metadata.version]
   provider = "scikit_build_core.metadata.regex"
   input = "CMakeLists.txt"
   regex = '(?s)project\s*\(\s*<repo>\s+VERSION\s+(?P<value>[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)'
   ```
   This is an MIT example: use the repository's selected license and include the notices for
   all material shipped in the wheel or source archive. Keep the kit's MIT notice when shipping
   copied template material. Use the selected Python minimum. The latter is a source requirement;
   native wheel tags still select the interpreter and platform actually built. The `nom_python`
   component is separate from the C++ SDK install and excluded from ordinary full installs.
5. Initialize submodules, create the [packaging environment](build.md#native-python-wheels)
   and build a wheel from the complete checkout. Add an integration test that installs the
   artifact into a clean environment and calls the underlying C++ API after making build-tree
   and original installed libraries unavailable. Test any bundled dependency chain as well.

Use the same tested compiler for the binding and C++ module libraries, whether built together
or imported. Normal C++ builds leave `<PROJECT>_BUILD_PYTHON=OFF` and do not need the packaging
environment. Change shared mechanisms in the template, then synchronize them into derived repos.

## A dependency

- **One of our repos:** a submodule with a relative URL, pinned to a release tag:
  ```bash
  git submodule add ../<dep>.git external/<dep>
  git -C external/<dep> checkout v<x.y.z>
  git add external/<dep>
  ```
  Then, in the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` before adding `src/`:
  ```cmake
  nom_require_submodule(external/<dep>)
  FetchContent_Declare(<dep> SOURCE_DIR ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/external/<dep>)
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(<dep>)
  ```
  Link `nom::<dep>` and import `nom.<dep>`. If exported CMake targets need it, add `<dep>` to
  `nom_install_package(DEPENDENCIES …)`.
- **Third-party code:** a shallow submodule, pinned to a release tag:
  ```bash
  git submodule add --depth 1 <url> external/<dep>
  git config -f .gitmodules submodule.external/<dep>.shallow true
  git -C external/<dep> fetch --depth 1 origin tag v<x.y.z>
  git -C external/<dep> checkout v<x.y.z>
  git add .gitmodules external/<dep>
  ```
  Then decide case by case: the same three CMake lines when its CMake project works as a
  subproject (nlohmann_json in cmake_template), or only its include directory when it doesn't.
  Use a module wrapper when it gives a useful, supported API boundary; otherwise include
  the dependency's headers where needed. Our library APIs belong in named modules.
- **Boost:** the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` calls `nom_find_boost()`. Link `Boost::program_options`,
  `Boost::filesystem` or `Boost::iostreams` where they are used, include their headers before
  imports or in a module unit's global module fragment, and add `Boost` to
  `nom_install_package(DEPENDENCIES …)` when exported targets link them. cmake_template's
  `apps/boost_example/` uses all three.
- **Other system libraries** (OpenSSL, …): `find_package(<Package> REQUIRED)`.

## An experiment

`python3 tools/kit/add_sandbox_app.py <name>` creates `apps/sandbox/<name>/`, built as
`bin/sandbox_<name>` and linked to the main library when `src/<repo>/`
exists. It uses `BUILD_FOR complete`:
run `cmake --workflow --preset complete`, or build its target explicitly in another preset. If an
experiment has its own support libraries, mark them `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL TRUE` so they build only
when a dependent app is requested. Experiments that need third-party code fetch it in their
own `CMakeLists.txt`. Experiments are git-ignored (`/apps/sandbox/*/` in `.gitignore`), so they
stay in the clone; when one is worth sharing, commit it by force with `git add -f`.

## A release

See [build.md](build.md#versioning).

Installed apps locate packaged shared libraries relative to their executable directory on
Unix/macOS. Shared libraries locate sibling packaged libraries in the install library
directory. These runtime paths follow GNUInstallDirs and remain valid when the complete
install prefix is moved; system dependencies still need to be installed on the host.
